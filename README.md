# Interactive Web Portfolio

A chance to practice my front-end coding and design skills, and also to share my personal and professional information with you!

## Getting Started
To set up a local copy and run the application, follow the steps below

### Create New Project

```sh
npm create vite@latest
```

Then you can type in your project name and select a framework and a language. I used React and JavaScript.

To open the project, run

```sh
cd {insert_your_project_name}
```

### Installation

```sh
npm install
```

### Run

To run the project locally

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then follow http://localhost:5173/ to view the website on your browser.

### Build

To create a production-ready version of your application, run

```sh
npm run build
```

To check if the production app runs properly, run

```sh
npm run preview
```
